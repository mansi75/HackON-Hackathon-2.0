Burnout is common in these days but not everyone is aware about it and so no one talks about it, even working from Home is not easy as people have to juggle work life and home life. Working from home means extended work hours and constant urge to do more work and constantly attending online meetings and for some they also have to manage kids at home. When someone is facing burnout it is a big mental issue since they can not work with a constant feeling of burnout and feeling exhausted all the time. If companies know which employee is facing burnout they can provide right help to to those people and can save lot of damage that burnout can do.
